First impressions in React-Native. Inspired by YouTube channel ProgramadorBR - Access in July 29 - 2020.

For tests you need to have React-Native workspace setted in your machine and then run these commands in terminal:
$ npx reactive-native start

Then, if you are running MacOS and want to try the app on iOS:
$ npx reactive-native run-ios

Or to run in a Android emulator:
$ npx reactive-native run-android
